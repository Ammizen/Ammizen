Hiya! My name is Ammizen, I'm an indie game designer, instrumentation technician, and freelance offensive security researcher.
I'm currently working on a few different projects, so replies may be a little slow but feel free to reach out to me via any of the methods provided below!

I specialize in c-like languages, though I'm always learning new techniques, and looking to learn new languages.
I have experience in c/c++, c#/.NET, javascript, html/css/php, java, python, ASM-6502, GML (GameMaker Language), and more.

You can reach me at any of the following accounts;

**Email:** Ammizen@ammizen.dev
**Discord:** Ammizen#1337

If you have any inquiries about my projects, please use my email rather than any of the other methods.
