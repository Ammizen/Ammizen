Hiya! My name is Ammizen, I'm an indie game designer, though wouldn't mind collaborating with other professionals.
I'm currently working on a few different projects, so replies may be a little slow but feel free to reach out to me via any of the methods provided below!

If you have any inquiries about my projects, please send an email to me rather than use one of the other methods.

I specialize in c++, java, python, and GML (GameMaker Language), though I'm always learning new techniques, and looking to learn new languages.

You can reach me at any of the following accounts;

**Email:** fuzzbutt@ammizen.dev
**Discord:** Ammizen#1337
**Skype:** fuzzbutt@ammizen.dev
